## Gasabo District: An informational Website

Implementation Challenges:

During the implementation process, we encountered several challenges that required careful consideration and problem-solving. These challenges included:

Adherence to Mockup Design: Ensuring faithfulness to the original mockup design while implementing dynamic and interactive elements posed a challenge.

Responsiveness: Achieving optimal responsiveness across various screen sizes and devices required thorough testing and adjustment.

Accessibility: Integrating accessibility features to ensure usability for individuals with disabilities required additional research and implementation efforts.

Time constraints: Implemention of all the whole pages in their interity.

Solutions:

To address these challenges, we:

Conducted Regular Reviews: Regularly reviewed our implementation against the mockup design to identify discrepancies and make necessary adjustments.


Prioritized Collaboration: Maintained open communication channels through GitHub, enabling effective collaboration and problem-solving among team members.


By documenting these challenges and solutions, we aim to provide insight into our implementation process and demonstrate our commitment to delivering a high-quality web application.
